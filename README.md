👾 Code Whisperer | Digital Dreamer | Rookie Googler 🔍

🌟 Turning Google searches into solutions and bugs into “learning opportunities” (eventually). I’m here to build cool things, break a few things (accidentally), and learn like there’s no tomorrow.

🚀 Tech Enthusiast:
	•	💡 Learning one line of code at a time
	•	🤖 Figuring out how to solve problems (with a little help from Stack Overflow)
	•	🌱 Proud beginner navigating the vast tech universe

🎯 Fun Facts:
	•	90% Google, 10% trial and error (and lots of error)
	•	My code runs… after I ask it nicely a few times
	•	Always looking for the next challenge to overthink

🌈 Follow along for: rookie mistakes, small victories, and a lot of enthusiasm.
